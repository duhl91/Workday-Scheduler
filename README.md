# Workday-Scheduler
When the schedulet is loaded, the current date and time show in the header. 
Time blocks are presented on the page for standard business hours, 
and they are color coded to display either past, present or future time windows. 
Clicking on the block will let the user enter data, and save it to the local server for later viewing, 
even when the page is refreshed.
